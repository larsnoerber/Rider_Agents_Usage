# AgentMeter Marketplace materials

## JetBrains Marketplace — first stable release 1.1.0

AgentMeter monitors OpenAI Codex, JetBrains AI, GitHub Copilot, Claude and Cursor in Rider.
Version 1.1.0 is the first stable release prepared for this listing. Earlier GitHub versions are development previews.
The existing plugin ID remains `io.github.larsnoerber.agentsusage` for upgrade compatibility.

The listing description is in `src/main/resources/META-INF/plugin.xml`. It introduces the current features,
requirements and privacy behavior without development changelog or migration text.
The description uses the release-tagged overview image; later source changes cannot alter this release's preview.

### Gallery images

All five images are **1280 × 800 PNG**, with editable SVG counterparts. They are illustrated examples,
not live account screenshots. Balances are fictional; provider cards are arranged for gallery readability.
No account data or credentials are read when rendering these images.

| File                                                     | Suggested caption                                                       |

| [Overview](images/agents-usage-overview.png)             | AgentMeter — five providers in one usage overview (illustrated example) |
| [Details](images/agents-usage-details.png)               | Click a subscription badge for details and charts (illustrated example) |
| [Status bar](images/agents-usage-statusbar.png)          | Provider quota colors in the status bar (illustrated example)           |

| [Weekly and Games](images/agents-usage-weekly-games.png) | Optional weekly boss battles and Tic-Tac-Toe (illustrated example)      |

Regenerate with `python tools/render_marketplace_preview.py` (Pillow and Windows Segoe UI required).
The existing Quota Portal logo is `images/agents-usage-logo.png`; the plugin's SVG logo stays in `META-INF`.

### Upload preparation

Create the media bundle with `python tools/package_jetbrains_marketplace.py` after building the Rider plugin.

The GitHub release provides `agentmeter-1.1.0.zip` for plugin upload and `agentmeter-marketplace-1.1.0.zip`
with the five gallery PNGs, logo, HTML description, release notes and upload instructions.

1. Upload the Rider plugin ZIP to JetBrains Marketplace with name **AgentMeter**.
2. Use the packaged `plugin.xml` description (or the matching `description.html` in the media bundle).
3. Upload the five PNGs under **Media**, retaining the illustrated-example captions.
4. Use **First stable release** as the release summary; the release notes introduce the available features.

Creating the ZIP and GitHub release does not submit the listing to JetBrains Marketplace.
The 1280 × 800 image format
follows [JetBrains Marketplace guidance](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/marketplace/jetbrains-marketplace-approval-guidelines.html).

## Other editors

The repository also contains separate VS Code and Visual Studio sources. This Rider release does not build their
packages. Their preview renderers and publishing materials remain in their respective directories.

## Standalone Windows Store materials

The standalone Windows app is a separate product/package, with ten provider choices and its own SVG-backed icon.
Use [Windows Store listing](../windows/Packaging/StoreListing.md), [privacy policy](../windows/Packaging/Privacy.md)
and [Windows verification status](../windows/TESTING.md). Its provider matrix differs from the Rider listing.
The MSIX is unsigned until a separate signing/Store process; generating it does not submit or install the app.
Source-only GitHub updates do not change the shared version, create a release or upload EXE/MSIX artifacts.
